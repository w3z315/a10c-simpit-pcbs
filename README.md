# My A10C SimPit PCB collection

Welcome to the A10C Simpit Projects repository! This repository contains all the PCB designs and DCS-Bios Arduino code for various components of an A10C Simpit, currently including the UFC (Up-Front Controller) and MFCD (Multi-Function Color Display).

## Sponsorship
Thank you so much PCBWay.com for sponsoring parts of this project! I was genuinely surprised by how quickly the PCBs arrived - in just 9 days, without even opting for the very express shipping variant. The quality is outstanding, and the PCBs work flawlessly in my setup. It's been a fantastic experience, from design submission to receiving the boards ready for assembly.

## Projects

### UFC (Up-Front Controller)
- **[PCB Design](./ufc/pcb)**: Schematic, layout files, and Bill of Materials (BOM) for the UFC PCB.
- **[Arduino Code](./ufc/arduino)**: Source code and libraries for the UFC Arduino project.

### MFCD (Multi-Function Color Display)
- **[PCB Design](./mfcd/pcb)**: Schematic, layout files, and Bill of Materials (BOM) for the MFCD PCB.
- **[Arduino Code](./mfcd/arduino)**: Source code and libraries for the MFCD Arduino project.

## Getting Started
